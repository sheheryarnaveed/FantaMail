## FantaMail

An emailing service made using react.js intended to simplify emails by using deep learning models. Currently, it is just a front-end stub with php back-end, within few weeks will be transfomred into a powerful deep learned application with features such as summarizing the email threads and making it a more easily handled mailbox. The idea will be extended to chatting applications in future.
